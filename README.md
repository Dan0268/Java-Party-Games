# Java-Party-Games

by Danijel Boskovic

A suite of Party Games made in Java! A little project that grew out of a Minesweeper challenge and was expanded to include a menu to start games from. Currently features Minesweeper using 2 dimensional arrays. Some effort went into presentation within the limit of an IntelliJ console.
